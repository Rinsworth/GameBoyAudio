# GameBoyAudio

Game Boy emulator written in C++ with the main objective to emulate sound.

I plan to use an external arbitary waveform generator until the main CPU and RAM/ROM functions of the emulator are functional, and then I plan to replace it with my own.

As of now, nothing works.

Documentation about the original Game Boy is coming from a variety of sources, of which are to be listed below.
