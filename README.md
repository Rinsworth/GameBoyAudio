# GameBoyAudio

Game Boy emulator written in C++ with the main objective to emulate sound.

I plan to make an arbitary waveform generator using SFML and plan to eventually control it using the CPU and RAM/ROM emulators.

As of now, sound works manually! Square waves and noise channels are functional with a driver, and sawtooth waves are next.

Documentation about the original Game Boy is coming from a variety of sources, of which are to be listed below.
